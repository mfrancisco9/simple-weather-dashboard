# simple-weather-dashboard
A 5-day multi-city weather dashboard utilizing the OpenWeather API. Created as a homework assignment for Northwestern's coding bootcamp.

User is able to use the box and button in the top left to submit a city name. The current and 5-day forecast will then populate using the OpenWeather API. The text field for UV index is color-coded to reflect the severity of the UV index (ranging from green to red) and likewise the 5-day forecast boxes receive a color based on the temprature range, from blue (cold) to dark red (very hot).

Recent searchs are saved in local storage, and if local storage exists they will automatically populate in the left-hand column.
